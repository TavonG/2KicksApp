# 2KicksApp
Custom Cleats & Sneakers project

- As a user I want to be able to see a list of custom cleats/kicks
- I want to be able to see details of each custom when tapped on
- details will include the brand, model, name of custom type, and the designer.
- As a user I want the option to add a photo of a custom shoe that I like and the details of it so others can find more designers who customize shoes and cleats

-Adding a list of some of the best custom shoes around shoulnd't be hard the app will have a list (maybe with imageView) so that way you instantly see shoes
-Since the details will display when tapped on, this will make the interaction of the app amazing, because at first you just see the list of shoes without any details.
